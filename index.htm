      <p>Don't be fooled into thinking your only choice this election season
      is between the lesser of two evils. A vote for Mesha shows this nation

        <h4>HUNGER</h4>
        <p>Let's face it, hunger is rampant in this country. I am proposing
        a brand new initiative <strong>tacos4america</strong> which would give
        every American the right to satiate their hunger with tasty tasty tacos.</p>
        <p>Hillary and Trump both oppose <strong>tacos4america</strong> saying
          "tacos are un-American" (Trump) and "where will the taco budget come
          from?" (Hillary). <strong>America, let's stop this needless hunger.</strong>

          Or the constant mis-use and abuse of 'their', 'there' and 'theyâ€™re.'</p>

      <h1>Running Mate Tim</h1>
      <p>"I'll be honest, I don't know why Mesha picked me as his running mate
        I'm just a fairly ok Web Developer. My knowledge of software development
        isn't exactly the right kind of experience, but Mesha is confident we will re-build
        the leadership starting from the top-down to work efficiently like software.
        (Also, if a moron real estate mogul has enough experience, so do I.)</p>
      <p>"Even if I don't fully understand his decision, I stand by it because
        he has a face you can trust. I believe Mesha is the only choice for America
        and if elected, I will do my utmost to support him and remove the bugs from
        our system."</p>
